# Notes App

A notes app built with ReactJS. Live demo [HERE](https://dragostemelie.go.ro/projects/notes-app/).

## Install and start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dragostemelie/notes-app.git
cd notes-app/
npm install
npm start
```

The app uses `localStorage` to hold the notes data. It is still a work in progress.
